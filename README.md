### What it does

------------------------------------------------------------------------

`registr` is intended to register exponential family functional data

Explain in detail what a binary curve is. Talk about accelerometer data application.

### Installation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the latest version directly from Github, please use:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("julia-wrobel/registr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### How to use it

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example highlights how to use the package for registering simulated binary data. More details on use of the package can be found in the package [vignette](inst/doc/registr.html).

The code below uses a function from our package to simulate curves for 100 subjects with 200 timepoints each, observed over domain (0,â€†1). All curves have similar structure but the location of the peak is shifted. On the observed domain *t*<sup>\*</sup> the curves are unregistered (misaligned). On the domain *t* the curves are registered (aligned).

``` r
library(registr)

registration_data = simulate_unregistered_curves(I = 100, D = 200, seed = 2018)
```

The plot below shows the unregistered curves and registered curves.

Continuously observed curves are shown above in order to illustrate the misalignment problem and our simulated data; the simulated dataset also includes binary values which have been generated by using these continuous curves as probabilities. The unregistered and registered binary curves for two subjects are shown below.

Our software registers curves by estimating *t*. For this we use the function `registration_fpca()`.

``` r
binary_registration = register_fpca(Y = registration_data, family = "binomial", 
                                                                Kt = 6, Kh = 3, npc  = 1)
## current iteration: 1
## current iteration: 2
## current iteration: 3
```

The plot below shows unregistered, true registered, and estimated registered binary curves two subjects after fitting our method.
